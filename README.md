### Project Details
In this project, I used;
- NextJS which is a ReactJS framework because of its advanced outlook on pages, components and styling. Grouping them easily without too much fine-tuning, right out of the box. From SEO support to smartly bundling production builds to typescript support (a big fan, although I didn't use it here because it's not really needed in this project) etc. Technically, I fancy the framework for its forward-thinking.

- Material UI because of how simple it is to style on-the go. Usually I'd use tailwind but for this project, Material UI did the job. The project doesn't require any fancy styling, so Material UI kept the code clean and the frontend clean.

- SASS because who wants the burden of vanilla css slowing them. Sass bundles css into better sizable bits. Yeah the css in this project isn't much but out of habit, SASS got incorporated for best practices purposes.

...And that's it! It was fun to build, incorporating conditionals, filtering through an object of arrays then hooking up the graphql endpoint.

Pretty fun
