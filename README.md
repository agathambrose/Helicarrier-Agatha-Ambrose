### Project Details
In this project, I used;
- NextJS which is a ReactJS framework because of its advanced outlook on pages, components and styling. Grouping them easily without too much fine-tuning, right out of the box.

- Material UI because of how simple it is to style on-the go. Usually I'd use tailwind but for this project, Material UI did the job. The project doesn't require any fancy styling and Material UI kept it clean regardless.

- SASS because who wants the burden of vanilla css slowing them. Sass bundles css into better sizable bits. Yeah the css in this project isn't much but out of habit, SASS got incorporated for best practices purposes.

...And that's it! It was fun to build, incorporating conditionals, filtering through an object of arrays then hooking up the graphql endpoint.
